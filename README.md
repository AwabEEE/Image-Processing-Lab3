📁 BMED469 - Biomedical Image Processing - Lab Homework 3
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of Lab Homework 3 from the BMED469 Biomedical Image Processing course. The task involves performing image convolution using a custom kernel (Laplacian filter) and calculating the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

📌 Objective
Apply a different convolution kernel (Laplacian) to an image.

Perform edge detection and enhancement.

Calculate and report the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

Display original and processed images.

🧠 Input Image
The brain.jpg image is used as the base for all image processing tasks.

Copy
Edit
Homework3
This will:

Read the input image.

Apply the Laplacian convolution.

Display the original and filtered images.

Print the calculated SNR in the command window.

✅ Output Example
The convolved image highlights edges and transitions in the original image.

SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) value will be printed in dB for analysis.

🔧 Requirements
MATLAB R2018a or newer (any version with conv2, imshow, and image processing support).
